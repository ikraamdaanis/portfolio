      About Me
    </h1>
    <p>
      I'm a software engineer based in the UAE, originally from London. Over the
      past few years, I've worked with companies like Cloudline, Sophos, and
      Pembee, building full-stack applications that serve hundreds of thousands
      of users across hospitality, cybersecurity, and booking management
      sectors.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-4">
      At Cloudline, I spent two years building their venue management platform,
      working on features like mobile Order & Pay systems, CRM integrations, and
      POS solutions for hotels, golf clubs, and entertainment venues. At Sophos,
      I contributed to the cybersecurity firm's web platforms and internal
      tools. Most recently at Pembee, I've developed their booking management
      system for classes, events, and afterschool programs, handling complex
      payment flows and customer management features.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-4">
      What drives me is solving real problems with thoughtful engineering. I
      don't just write code. I think through edge cases, plan for scalability,
      and make sure what I build is maintainable long after I'm done. When you
      work with me, you get someone who cares about the details and takes
      ownership of the entire process, from initial concept to deployment.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-4">
      I specialize in React and Next.js, and I'm comfortable across the full
      stack, whether that's designing APIs, optimizing database queries, or
      fine-tuning frontend performance. I work well independently and can
      integrate seamlessly into existing teams.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-4">
      Outside of work, you'll find me training Muay Thai, tinkering with side
      projects, or reading about system design and web performance. I believe
      good software comes from understanding both the technical and human sides
      of the problem.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-4">
      I'm currently available for freelance projects. If you're looking for
      someone reliable who delivers quality work on time, let's talk.
